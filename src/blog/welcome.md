Welcome to my portfolio! This site is a celebration of the Bauhaus design movement and an exploration of how its principles can be applied to modern web development.

## The Bauhaus Philosophy

The Bauhaus school, founded in 1919, revolutionized design by emphasizing:

1. **Form follows function** - Design should prioritize purpose over decoration
2. **Unity of art and technology** - Bridging the gap between craft and industry
3. **Simplicity and minimalism** - Removing unnecessary elements
4. **Geometric abstraction** - Using basic shapes as building blocks

## Applying Bauhaus to the Web

In this portfolio, I've translated these principles into digital form:

### Color Palette

The primary color scheme draws directly from Bauhaus: bold reds (`#e31e24`), deep blues (`#004f9f`), and vibrant yellows (`#ffd100`). These colors aren't just aesthetic choices—they create clear visual hierarchy and guide user attention.

### Typography

Clean, sans-serif typefaces dominate the design, echoing the Bauhaus preference for functional, readable typography. The modular scale ensures consistent proportions throughout.

### Geometric Elements

Circles, squares, and triangles appear throughout the interface, both as decorative elements and functional components. These shapes create visual interest while maintaining the clean, organized aesthetic.

## Technical Implementation

This site is built with:

- **Eleventy**: A simple, powerful static site generator
- **Nunjucks**: Flexible templating
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For a maintainable design system
- **Docker**: For consistent deployment

The entire codebase follows the same principles as the design: clean, functional, and purposeful.

## What's Next

I'll be sharing more about the design and development process in future posts. Topics will include:

- Building a design system from scratch
- CSS architecture for maintainable projects
- Performance optimization techniques
- Docker deployment strategies

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the projects!
