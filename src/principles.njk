            Six core tenets that guide every design decision in Humanist Modernism, prioritizing human comfort, clarity, and empathetic communication over geometric abstraction.

            <h2 class="principle-title">1. Readability Paramount</h2>
            
            <p>
                Readability is not a secondary consideration—it is the primary design goal. Every decision about typography, spacing, and layout must serve comfortable, sustained reading. Body text must be generous (18-21px minimum), with ample line-height (1.6–1.8x the font size) to prevent eye strain and accommodate readers of all ages and abilities.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When readability is compromised for aesthetic novelty, users suffer. When readability is prioritized, beauty emerges naturally from functional clarity. This principle inverts the hierarchy of cold modernism: the reader's comfort comes before the designer's vision.

            <h2 class="principle-title">2. Generous Spacing and Vertical Rhythm</h2>
            
            <p>
                Whitespace is not empty space—it is essential breathing room. Generous margins, ample paragraph spacing, and open letter-spacing prevent visual fatigue and create a calm, unhurried reading experience. Vertical rhythm (consistent spacing between paragraphs, headings, and sections) establishes a visual pace that guides the reader through content.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Humanist Modernism, spaciousness conveys respect. When a designer chooses to leave generous margins instead of filling every pixel, they communicate that the reader's comfort and cognitive experience matter more than information density. This generosity is not wasteful—it is an investment in clarity and user wellbeing.

            <h2 class="principle-title">3. Optimal Measure: Constrained Line Length</h2>
            
            <p>
                The optimal reading measure—the ideal distance an eye travels in a single line—is 60-75 characters per line. This constraint, derived from cognitive psychology research, respects the limits of human perception. Lines longer than this measure force the eye to work harder and increase the likelihood of losing the reading position during visual return.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Constraining line length is not a limitation imposed by designers—it is a liberation for readers. By setting maximum widths (typically 700-800px for body text), designers acknowledge that fitting more content on screen matters less than enabling comfortable reading. This principle applies across all devices: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

            <h2 class="principle-title">4. Empathetic Typography: Humanist Typefaces</h2>
            
            <p>
                Humanist Modernism employs typefaces designed for human perception, not geometric purity. Typefaces like Frutiger, FF Meta, Inter, and Gill Sans feature open apertures (large openings in letters like "a," "e," and "c"), variable stroke widths (subtle thickness variations that aid recognition), and warm proportions that feel approachable rather than mechanical.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These typefaces contrast sharply with cold geometric sans-serifs like Helvetica or univers (geometric), which prioritize mechanical uniformity. Humanist typefaces acknowledge that humans don't read through geometric decoding—they recognize letters through subtle contextual distinctions. By using typefaces designed for human eyes, designers respect users' visual comfort and cognitive efficiency.

            <h2 class="principle-title">5. Content-First Design</h2>
            
            <p>
                Form serves content. Typography, layout, color, and interface design exist to clarify and elevate content—never to distract from it or express the designer's personal vision. In Humanist Modernism, the designer is invisible when the design succeeds. The user is aware only of the content and their understanding of it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This principle rejects the notion that design is personal artistic expression. Design is communication. Every visual element must earn its place by serving comprehension. Decorative complexity that doesn't communicate is noise. Aggressive colors that don't emphasize meaning are visual clutter. Content-first design means eliminating everything that doesn't serve the reader's understanding.

            <h2 class="principle-title">6. Warmth Over Coldness: Accessible Color and Tone</h2>
            
            <p>
                Color palettes in Humanist Modernism employ warm, muted tones—sage greens, warm grays, clay earth tones, soft blues—rather than aggressive primary colors or high-contrast, clinical combinations. These colors feel human-scaled and approachable. They reduce eye strain during sustained viewing and create an emotional atmosphere of calm and trust.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This principle extends beyond color to overall tone and voice. Content is written in warm, accessible language. Interfaces communicate with users as respected peers, not subordinates. Error messages acknowledge mistakes without blame. Success states celebrate user accomplishment. Every interaction conveys respect for the user's intelligence, time, and wellbeing.

            <h2 class="summary-title">How These Principles Work Together</h2>
            
            <p>
                These six principles are not independent rules—they form an integrated philosophy of human-centered design. Readability requires generous spacing and optimal measure. Empathetic typography supports comfortable reading. Content-first design ensures that every supporting element (spacing, color, typeface) serves clarity. Warmth in tone and color creates an atmosphere where users feel respected.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When all six principles are applied together, the result is not minimalism (cold and sparse) or maximalism (rich and overwhelming), but <strong>clarity serving humanity</strong>. Users can read for extended periods without fatigue. They understand complex information easily. They feel respected by the design. And they are unaware of the design itself—they are aware only of the content and their engagement with it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the highest achievement of Humanist Modernism: design so thoughtful that it disappears, leaving only clarity and human connection.
