## Project Overview

The Bauhaus Revival Portfolio is a modern interpretation of the iconic Bauhaus design movement, applied to web development. This project showcases how timeless design principles can be adapted for contemporary digital experiences.

### Key Features

- **Geometric Design Language**: Clean lines, bold shapes, and primary colors
- **Modern Static Site**: Built with Eleventy for performance and simplicity
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Seamless theme switching with local storage
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized for easy deployment and development

### Design Philosophy

The project adheres to three core Bauhaus principles:

1. **Form Follows Function**: Every element serves a purpose
2. **Simplicity**: Minimal, clean design without unnecessary ornamentation
3. **Geometric Abstraction**: Bold use of circles, squares, and triangles

### Technology Stack

- **Eleventy 3.x**: Static site generator
- **Nunjucks**: Templating engine
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Design token system
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **Nginx**: Production web server

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Balancing modern web performance with rich visual design.

**Solution**: Implemented a component-based CSS architecture with critical CSS inline and progressive enhancement for animations.

**Challenge**: Creating a flexible color system that works in both light and dark themes.

**Solution**: Developed a comprehensive CSS custom properties system with semantic color tokens that adapt automatically to theme changes.

### Results

- 98+ Lighthouse performance score
- Fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- 100% responsive across all devices
- Fast build times (< 1 second for development)

### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:

- Static site generation and JAMstack architecture
