            <p>
                iA Writer stands as a canonical example of Humanist Modernism in digital product design. The application strips away decorative elements and geometric distractions, placing the reader's experience at the absolute center of its design philosophy.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Optimal Reading Measure</h3>
            <p>
                The text editor constrains the writing area to approximately 65-75 characters per line—the scientifically proven optimal width for reading comfort. This constraint is not a limitation but a liberation: it forces writers to consider their audience's visual comfort and cognitive load. Each character is deliberately positioned within a generous, readable measure, echoing Edward Tufte's insistence that clarity serves the reader first.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Typography as Content</h3>
            <p>
                iA Writer uses carefully selected typefaces—often system fonts like SF Pro Display on macOS—that prioritize legibility over personality. The font size defaults to 16-18px, with line-height set to approximately 1.6-1.7, providing ample breathing room for the text. This is humanist typography: warm, open, and designed to serve the reader's eyes, not to make a design statement.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Minimal Interface, Maximum Focus</h3>
            <p>
                The application's interface vanishes during use. Menus collapse, toolbars hide, and the entire experience reduces to text on a screen. This minimalism is not coldness—it's warmth expressed through absence. By removing geometric decorations and aggressive UI elements, iA Writer honors the user's cognitive resources and respects their time.
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
                Medium's design philosophy represents a watershed moment in Humanist Modernism on the web. While it has evolved over the years, its core commitment remains unwavering: optimize every design decision around the reading experience.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Generous Typography</h3>
            <p>
                Medium's default body text size is 18-21px—directly aligned with Humanist Modernism's prescription. The line-height exceeds 1.7, often reaching 1.75 or higher, creating the "breathing room" that Edward Tufte advocated for in information design. These decisions are not aesthetic flourishes; they are foundational commitments to reader comfort.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Paragraph Spacing & Visual Rhythm</h3>
            <p>
                Between paragraphs, Medium employs generous vertical spacing—often 1.5em or more. This spacing accomplishes multiple goals: it prevents visual fatigue, creates natural stopping points for readers to absorb ideas, and establishes a calm, unhurried reading pace. The generous spacing reflects an underlying humanist philosophy: the reader's cognitive experience matters more than fitting more content on the screen.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Color & Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                Medium uses warm, neutral colors—typically dark gray text (#2c2c2c or similar) on near-white backgrounds (#f9f9f9). This color palette, influenced by humanist design principles, reduces eye strain and creates a warm, inviting reading environment. Links use muted, warm accent colors rather than jarring primary colors, maintaining visual harmony while remaining functional.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Content-Centered Layout</h3>
            <p>
                The article width is constrained to approximately 700-760px, ensuring no single line exceeds optimal reading length. This constraint is enforced across all devices, with responsive behavior that maintains readability on mobile and desktop alike. The layout serves the content, not the screen.
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
                While Edward Tufte is not a digital product designer, his work on information visualization forms the philosophical foundation of Humanist Modernism's approach to design. His principles of data-ink ratio, chartjunk elimination, and reader-centric clarity directly influence how HM practitioners approach digital interfaces.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Maximizing Data-Ink Ratio</h3>
            <p>
                Tufte's concept of the "data-ink ratio" asserts that every pixel should serve a purpose: conveying information to the reader. Decorative elements—drop shadows, gradients, 3D effects, geometric abstraction—are eliminated ruthlessly. In Humanist Modernism, this principle extends beyond data visualization to entire interfaces: every visual element must earn its place by serving the user's understanding.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Eliminating Chartjunk</h3>
            <p>
                Tufte's famous attack on "chartjunk"—unnecessary decorations that obscure data—parallels Humanist Modernism's rejection of Bauhaus geometric ornament. A bar chart decorated with triangles and circles is not more beautiful; it is actively harmful to comprehension. Similarly, a navigation menu decorated with geometric shapes distracts from its primary function: helping users find information.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Respecting the Reader's Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
                Tufte's work is fundamentally humanist because it assumes readers are intelligent and capable of absorbing complex information when it is presented clearly. There is no "dumbing down" of content, no oversimplification, no patronizing explanations. Instead, Tufte advocates for dense, information-rich presentations that trust the reader's ability to engage deeply. This respect for the reader is at the heart of Humanist Modernism.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="example-subtitle">Typography in Service of Clarity</h3>
            <p>
                In his books and presentations, Tufte uses generous margins, ample whitespace, and carefully selected typefaces to maximize comprehension. His layouts are not minimal in the Bauhaus sense (geometric, spare) but humanist in their approach: every element of typography, spacing, and layout exists to serve the reader's understanding and comfort.

            <p>
                These three canonical examples—iA Writer, Medium, and Edward Tufte's work—share fundamental commitments that define Humanist Modernism:
            </p>
            
            <ul class="example-principles">
                <li>
                    <strong>Content First:</strong> Design decisions are made in service of content clarity and reader comfort, not aesthetic novelty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generous Typography:</strong> Body text sizes exceed 16px, line-heights exceed 1.6, and letter-spacing is open and natural. The reader's eyes matter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Optimal Reading Measure:</strong> Line length is constrained to 65-80 characters, respecting cognitive and visual limits of human reading.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Warmth Over Coldness:</strong> Colors are warm neutrals and earth tones. Interfaces feel human-scaled and approachable, not mechanical or austere.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Elimination of Ornament:</strong> Geometric decorations, aggressive animations, and visual noise are removed. What remains serves a purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Respect for Intelligence:</strong> Designs trust the reader's ability to understand complex information. Clarity is achieved through organization and typography, not simplification.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                These examples demonstrate that Humanist Modernism is not a historical aesthetic to be revived, but a living, evolving philosophy that continues to shape digital design today. When we prioritize the reader over the designer, clarity over novelty, and human comfort over geometric abstraction, we create designs that endure.
